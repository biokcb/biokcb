### Hi, I'm Kristen, a research scientist. ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ¤– I am currently working as a data scientist in the medical robotics industry, which eats up my most of my time. 

- ğŸ’» Most of the commits on this page are from graduate school and personal projects from then, but I hope to work on these some more soon

- ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning more advanced R and Shiny

- ğŸ¤” Also looking into putting together a website, which I've started a bunch of times before and then deleted.. 

- ğŸ˜‚ Might just be adding this profile because my green commit box history looks sad this year
